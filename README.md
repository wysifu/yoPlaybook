# yoPlaybook
the book you always needed...

just 3/5ths of the whole idea. ultimately will be a full stack web app but i have to learn more about
the back end and databases before the playbook is ready for game situations..

thinking of using django but i dont know, i need a dashboard page and a calander page with 
conditional formatting
